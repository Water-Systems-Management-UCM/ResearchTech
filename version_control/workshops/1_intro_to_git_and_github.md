# Introduction to Git and GitHub
Length: ~ 1 hour
1. General concepts (commits, clones, branches, push/pull, forks, pull requests)
2. Using Git solo to keep track of code and document research
3. Using Git/GitHub to work on the same code with multiple people using forks and pull requests
4. Tagging, releases, and downloads

## Prerequisites
[Install GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) before the workshop if you want to follow along with parts of it. If you are comfortable with another Git
client, then you can use that, but this one is great for the most common operations.
