# Documentation
## Core Concepts
 
## Description
Documentation tools help by integrating the specifics of code we write with narrative about how to use that code, its behaviors, etc. Code comments are important on their own for improving code quality and reproducability, but documentation tools can take code comments and package them into an interlinked set of web pages that describe functions, classes, variables, and more in a package. You can then add examples, graphics, structure, and additional descriptive text to support the automatically generated documentation.
 
## Examples
## Resources
* Sphinx (mostly for Python, but useful elsewhere)
* Roxygen (R Packages)
