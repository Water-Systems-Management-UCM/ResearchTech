# Research Tech Tools, Information, and Talks
Planning, slides, and materials for research tech trainings. Trainings will come in a few flavors:
 * 10 minute tech, where a topic gets a 10 minute treatment that covers:
	* An introduction to the specific tool or context
	* What it can help researchers with
	* Who might want to use it
	* Where to learn more
 * Material in this repository that can be used for review and as resources
 * Longer demos and trainings on core topics (such as version control)
 
 These will be recorded and published as a series to YouTube (or other site) as well

## Resources
Resources are currently broken into each folder in this repository. Each folder has a README with some general
information, but will also include resources and talks for learning methods in that topic.

## Schedule
TBD

## Planned Topics for Talks
[See talk_topics.md for a list of topics I'd like to cover](talk_topics.md)
